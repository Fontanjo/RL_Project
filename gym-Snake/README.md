README file for Snake gym environment!




# TODO

- [ ] Add new shapes
  - [ ] Shuriken
  - [ ] Double
  - [x] Custom
  - [ ] Maze
  - [ ] Random
  - [ ] ...
- [x] Add pacman effect  
  Sometime already working :D, sometime NOT! (especially in checking new position)  
  I think it works if you first go left/up, because array index with negative number is possible (but not with number > max index)
- [ ] Improve graphic (draw snake border (!! RL agent can not see this! But probably not important))
- [ ] Create decent README
  - [ ] Describe requisite of custom board
  - [ ] Describe arguments (e.g. possible boards)
  - [ ] Show stats (e.g. points/length)




- [x] Create basic env
- [x] Render in human mode
